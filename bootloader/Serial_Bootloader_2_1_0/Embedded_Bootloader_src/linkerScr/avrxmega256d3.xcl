 * Compiler generated segments
 *
 * There are currently three compiler generated segments. These are used
 * for storing information that is vital for the operation of the program.
 *
 * The first segment is the SWITCH segment which contains data statements
 * used in the switch library routines. These tables are encoded in such a
 * way as to use as little space as possible.
 *
 * The second segment, INITTAB, contains the segment initialization
 * description blocks that are used by the __segment_init function which is
 * called by cstartup. This table consists of a number of SegmentInitBlock_Type
 * objects. This type is declared in the segment_init.h file located in the
 * AVR\SRC\LIB directory.
 *
 * Tha last segment is only used when a source file has been compiled
 * in EC++ mode and the file contained global objects (class instances).
 * The segment will then contain a number of function pointers that
 * point to constructor methods that should be executed for each object.

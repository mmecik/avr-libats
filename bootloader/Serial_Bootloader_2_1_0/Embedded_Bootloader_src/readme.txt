Revision history:

1.0 - Initial revision.

1.1 - ATmega1281\2561 is supported.

1.2 - SPI serializer support is added for xMega, with the following parameters:
 - frequency is less or equal to 200kHz
 - start of SPI clock after slave select greater or equal to 100ns
 - delay between consecutive transfers greater or equal to 100us

spiFlasher is added to test the SPI part of the embedded bootloader (valid for the SAM7X evaluation board only).
Hardware sources used by spiFlasher:
 - IRQ1 - interrupt line for the slave data ready station (A15 on S3)
 - SPI1 - SPI interface (clock - A23, mosi - A24, miso - A25, ss - A26 on S3)

1.3 - Loading from external flash is supported for ATmega1281. The AT25f2048 external SPI flash is used. 
USART0 is used in MSPI mode; pin F3 is set as chip select. Size of boot section is 4 kbytes.

1.4 - Service area are increased (by 1 byte) for the external flash loader.

1.5 - ATmega128rfa1 is supported.

1.6 - ATxmega256d3 is supported. AT45db041 can be used for the bootloader with OTAU support.
xMega(ATxmega256a\d3) supports external flash. Both MCUs use SPI on port D to connect to external flash.
ATmega1281 and ATmega128rfa1 support AT25f2058 and AT45db041.
ATxmega256a3 and ATxmega256d3 support AT45db041.
Workaround is introduced for the following problem with xMega:
"Writing EEPROM or Flash while reading any of them will not work".

1.7 - Functions for RF4CE OTAU are added (only for ATmega1281 and ATmega128rfa1 and compilation with GCC)

1.8 - Start procedure was refactored: several interfaces are supported in a single
bootloader assembly; all interfaces scan for host's activity for 200ms by turn with 
one interface becoming main when host's activity is detected. 
IAR support is dropped.

2.0 - IAR projects are restored. AVR Studio 5 projects are added.

AT91SAM3S4C is supported, and the device firmware upgrade class of usb is supported.
Cortex bootloader is placed in the last 4kb of the internal flash memory (exclude vectors). Vectors are eliminated upon the
first image downloading (exclude reset vector). Bootloader stores the reset vector of the user's application and runs it 
by itself. A user's application can initiate a bootloading process by the use of the DFU application part from the BitCloud package 
or by writing the key byte 0x5A into the fifth byte to the end of the internal flash memory. Besides, the restoring mode 
can be initiated by connecting PB7 to the ground and turning it off\on. To load an image to a device the user can use
Bootloader PC Tool from the BitCloud package or dfu-util.exe (an open source utility, with max packet size equal to 64 bytes).

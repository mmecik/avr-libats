Elevator Control System.

Input  (requests from some device)
Output (commands to devices that control motion)

2 Kinds of Input:

- Up/Down and a Floor Number (potential passengers)
- A target floor to go to (actual passengers)

If an elevator is full, potential passengers will 
be ignored, BUT suppose elevators are greedy and 
not cognicent of capacity.

FSCAN Scheduling.

2 Queues

Current Queue
Future Queue

When the elevator switches direction, it switches direction.

Each queue has fixed size, so it is possible that they
will need to "drop" requests. It should never be the case, however,
that a target floor is ignored (ignoring people in the elevator 
would be bad).
